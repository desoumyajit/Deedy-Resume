% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Industry Experience}
\runsubsection{Microsoft}
\descript{| Senior Data \& Applied Scientist, Search Advertising R\&R}
\location{Dec 2018 - Present | Bangalore, IN}
Leading the modeling team's efforts in improving the clickability \& quality of Search \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/51001/1}{Ad-Extensions} \& \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56794/0}{Dynamic Search Ads} (DSA) across EMEA, APAC \& LATAM markets.
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Introduced click-prediction (CP) models for extensions \& DSA headlines utilising historical signals, contributing \textbf{3-6\% revenue} across tiers.
\item Developed a global feature-store, upgrading on the region-specific design, extending ranking service \textbf{from 5 to 100+ markets}.
\item Incorporated semantic query-context signals into a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network}{Siamese} BERT model for CP, resulting in a \textbf{+3\% $\Delta$AUC} on impressed ads.
\item Curated an offline selection approach for autogenerated extensions using historical query-context features. Exploited marginalised scores from a semantic CP model while allowing for random exploration. Scaled \& globalised this pipeline, \textbf{enabling daily ranking of $\sim$10B items}.
\item Addressed a combinatorial variant ranking problem by formulating a theoretical approach, conducting large-scale hypothesis testing, defining features, and using \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13535.pdf}{DCNv2} model. This resulted in an offline \textbf{+4\% $\Delta$AUC} on impressed ads.
\item Designed an E2E personalisation paradigm leveraging long-term and real-time user-interest signals to provide a personalised ranking scheme, making the items more relevant and diverse.

\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed \& implemented a majority of the \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/marketplace/partner-portal/rest-api-publisher/rest-endpoints.html}{Marketplace REST API}.
\item Employed batch-processing \& application-layer caching to reduce the
response times of \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/marketplace/partner-portal/rest-api-publisher/op-publisher-v1-applications-get.html}{multi-page GET-calls} from \textbf{$\sim$2 mins to $\sim$10 secs}.
\item Implemented a seamless onboarding workflow of \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/platform-for-saas/user/get-started-oracle-cloud-platform-oracle-saas1.html#GUID-08262917-456A-4D82-A093-212443319654}{existing SaaS customers to PaaS service offerings} within a tenant automation framework.

\location{May 2016 – Jul 2016 | London, UK}

\item Devised a cache-friendly algorithm for non-parametric two-sample tests involving \href{https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/gretton12a/gretton12a.pdf}{MMD estimator} that showed \textbf{$\sim$300x speed-up} over na\"ive implementation.
\item Proposed \& implemented a multi-threaded variant that outperformed competing algorithms, built with state-of-the-art solvers, by \textbf{reducing the runtime tenfold}.
\item Co-authored a paper \cite{SutherlandTSDRS17} where this is utilised in a discriminator for GANs.
