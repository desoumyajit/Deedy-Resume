% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\descript{| Senior Data \& Applied Scientist, Search Advertising R\&R}
\location{Dec 2018 - Present | Bangalore, IN}
%\textbf{Role}: Leading RichAds modeling team's technical efforts in improving the clickability \& quality of Search \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/51001/1}{Ad-Extensions} \& \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56794/0}{Dynamic Search Ads} Assets across INTL markets.\\
\project{Online Ranking}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Introduced online ranking of all ad assets to major markets using low-latency click-prediction models utilising statistical signals. Obtained 1.5-2\% $\Delta$CTR.
\item Introduced unified feature stores, trained unified models to serve across multiple clusters, extending ranking support to 100+ markets across the globe.
\item Improved model by integrating textual signals from query, headline and ad asset using a multilingual encoder. Improved overall $\Delta$AUC by 4\%, helping with the cold-start problem. Addressed signal sparsity in low-volume markets through knowledge distillation and met latency demands for inference with cached embeddings. Obtained +0.3-2.0\%$\Delta$CTR across markets.
\end{tightemize}
\project{Personalisation}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Performed scope analysis for coverage, proposed improvement through integrating user-profile signals in ranking, relevance, and selection for ad assets. Designed roadmap and drove the initiative from proposal to delivery working with multiple cross-functional and cross-geographic teams.
\item Sourced user signals from different services across products into homogeneous text features using in-context learning. Examined user-interest clusters and explored approaches to capture diversity and recency of interests. 
\item Customised and fine-tuned an encoder to output lower dimensional embeddings, meeting capacity budgets while maintaining quality (0.065\%$\to$0.058\% $\Delta$AUC). Owned global integration of this approach (+0.2\%$\Delta$CTR on personalisable slice). Working on integration in online selection and relevance in an advisory role.
\end{tightemize}
\project{Offline Selection}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Proposed, implemented and delivered an approach for offline selection of daily generated ad-assets utilising rankscore over historical queries for the ad. Worked with partner team on training a global variant of this approach. Exploited sampling to address the scale of ranking $\sim$10B items every day (+0.1-0.3\%$\Delta$CTR).
\end{tightemize}
\project{Asset Generation}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Increased candidate density (1.5-2.0x) globally with zero-shot asset generation using an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder model (+0.22\%$\Delta$Revenue).
\item Working with integration of expanded query, summarised landing page, and user profile for adaptive online asset generation in zero-shot setting. Exploring S/M/LLMs for knowledge distillation and preference optimisation utilising quality check models.
\end{tightemize}
%\textbf{Asset Generation}
%\begin{tightemize}
% \item Formulated a theoretical approach for a combinatorial variant ranking problem. Conducted large-scale hypothesis testing and defined relevant features. Demonstrated the potential using a DCNv2 model.
%\end{tightemize}
%\project{Engineering \& Leadership}
%\begin{tightemize}

\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed and implemented a majority of the \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/marketplace/partner-portal/rest-api-publisher/rest-endpoints.html}{Marketplace REST API}.
\item Employed batch-processing and application-layer caching to reduce the
response times of \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/marketplace/partner-portal/rest-api-publisher/op-publisher-v1-applications-get.html}{multi-page GET-calls} from $\sim$2 mins to $\sim$10 secs.
