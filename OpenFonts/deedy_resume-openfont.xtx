% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\location{Dec 2018 – Present | Bangalore, IN}
%\textbf{Role}: Leading RichAds modeling team's technical efforts in improving the clickability \& quality of Search \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/51001/1}{Ad-Extensions} \& \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56794/0}{Dynamic Search Ads} Assets across INTL markets.\\
\project{CTR Prediction}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Introduced ranking of all ad decorations in top 5 INTL markets using low-latency CTR-prediction models using statistical features (+1.5-2\% $\Delta$CTR).
\item Unified feature stores, trained a single model to serve across multiple clusters, extending ranking support to 100+ INTL markets across the globe.
\item Improved model utilising semantic signals from query, creatives and decorations.
\item Addressed signal sparsity in low-volume markets by fine-tuning a pretrained encoder and adopted distillation with pseudo labels. Improved overall $\Delta$AUC by 4\%, helping with the cold-start problem. Met latency demands with lightweight student model and cached embeddings (+0.3-2.0\% $\Delta$CTR across markets).
\end{tightemize}
\project{Personalisation}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Improved personalisation in decoration ranking by introducing dense-match features utilising user-profile signals (+0.2\% $\Delta$CTR on personalisable slice).
\item Generated text features from 2 sources using in-context learning. Leveraged similar signals developed by another team. Examined user-interest clusters and explored approaches to capture recency and diversity in user embeddings.
\item Customised and fine-tuned an encoder to output lower dimensional embeddings, meeting capacity budgets while maintaining quality (+0.21\% $\downarrow$ +0.16\% $\Delta$AUC).
\item Led addition of platform support and integration across the globe (AMER + INTL), collaborating with Engineering and partner teams. Driving adoption in other related areas including creative ranking, decoration relevance, decoration retrieval.
\end{tightemize}
\project{Offline Filtration}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Addressed Key-Value store capacity limitation by introducing an estimated click-yield based filtration strategy for algo-generated decorations. (+0.1-0.3\% $\Delta$CTR).
\item Utilised historical queries for the ad, used sampling to address the scale of scoring 10B (approx) items daily. Worked with partner team on training a global model.
\end{tightemize}
\project{Ad Decoration/Creative Generation}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Addressed lower candidate density in smaller markets and overall quality with zero-shot decoration generation offline in INTL markets. Utilised an instruction tuned encoder decoder model. (+1.5-2.0x $\Delta$Coverage, +0.22\% $\Delta$Revenue).
\item Worked on improving attractiveness of creatives with query-pivoted asset generation online. Explored frozen M/LLMs as distillation targets for zero-shot generation. Proposed dataset curation strategies for supervised fine-tuning of an SLM, addressing different demands across categories, volume and language (Ongoing).
\end{tightemize}
%\textbf{Asset Generation}
%\begin{tightemize}
% \item Formulated a theoretical approach for a combinatorial variant ranking problem. Conducted large-scale hypothesis testing and defined relevant features. Demonstrated the potential using a DCNv2 model.
%\end{tightemize}
%\project{Engineering \& Leadership}
