% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\descript{| Senior Data \& Applied Scientist, Search Advertising R\&R}
\location{Dec 2018 - Present | Bangalore, IN}
%\textbf{Role}: Leading RichAds modeling team's technical efforts in improving the clickability \& quality of Search \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/51001/1}{Ad-Extensions} \& \href{https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56794/0}{Dynamic Search Ads} Assets across INTL markets.\\
\project{Online Ranking}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Introduced online ranking of ad-assets using low-latency click-prediction models  utilising language-agnostic statistical signals to \highlight{100+ markets across the globe}.
\item Improved model by using semantic query-context signals with a \highlight{multilingual} encoder for tackling the \highlight{cold-start} problem. Addressed signal sparsity in low-volume markets \& latency demands for inference through sampling, \highlight{knowledge distillation} and \highlight{cached-embeddings}. Obtained +0.3-2.0\%$\Delta$CTR across markets.
\end{tightemize}
\project{Offline Selection}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Ideated \& implemented an approach for offline selection utilising rankscore over historical queries. Worked with partner team on globalisation. Explored \highlight{sampling strategies} to address the scale of ranking 10B items everyday (+0.1-0.3\%$\Delta$CTR).
\end{tightemize}
\project{Personalisation \& Diversity}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Defined scope in selection \& ranking, chalked out roadmap and tackled engineering challenges, drove the initiative from \highlight{proposal to delivery} working with \highlight{multiple cross-functional teams} (+0.2\%$\Delta$CTR on personalisable slice).
\item Sourced user signals from different services across products into homogeneous text features using \highlight{in-context learning}. Examined \highlight{user-interest clusters} and explored approaches to capture diverse historical interests. \highlight{Customised \& finetuned} an encoder to output lower dimensional embeddings, meeting capacity budgets while maintaining quality (0.065\%$\to$0.058\% $\Delta$AUC).
%\item Achieved sig AUC gains and improved dwell-time on triggered slices.
\end{tightemize}
\project{Candidate Generation}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Increased candidate density (1.5-2.0$\times$) globally with zero-shot \highlight{offline asset generation} using an instruction-tuned seq2seq model (+0.22\%$\Delta$Revenue).
\item Working with LLM expanded query, summarised landing page and user profile for \highlight{contextualised online asset generation} in zero-shot setting. Exploring S/MLMs for knowledge distillation, preference optimisation with feedback.
\end{tightemize}
%\textbf{Asset Generation}
%\begin{tightemize}
% \item Formulated a theoretical approach for a combinatorial variant ranking problem. Conducted large-scale hypothesis testing and defined relevant features. Demonstrated the potential using a DCNv2 model.
%\end{tightemize}
\project{Engineering \& Leadership}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Owning the \highlight{modeling infra globalisation} initiative, working in an advisory role for ideation \& identifying scope across teams, providing hands-on \highlight{mentorship} to new joiners, designing utilities automating common tasks for the team.

\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed \& implemented a majority of the \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/marketplace/partner-portal/rest-api-publisher/rest-endpoints.html}{Marketplace REST API}.
\item Employed batch-processing \& application-layer caching to reduce the
response times of \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/marketplace/partner-portal/rest-api-publisher/op-publisher-v1-applications-get.html}{multi-page GET-calls} from \highlight{$\sim$2 mins to $\sim$10 secs}.

\item Devised a cache-friendly algorithm for non-parametric two-sample tests involving \href{https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/gretton12a/gretton12a.pdf}{MMD estimator} that showed \highlight{$\sim$300x speed-up} over na\"ive implementation.
\item Proposed \& implemented a multi-threaded variant that outperformed competing algorithms, built with state-of-the-art solvers, by \highlight{an order of magnitude} \cite{SutherlandTSDRS17}.
%\item Co-authored a paper \cite{SutherlandTSDRS17} where this is utilised in a critic for generators in GANs.
